Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    create a parent child class and do 100% width on the child and have the ability to adjust the width of the parent?

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    elements are considered boxes. the box model allows us to modify the spacing and surrounding of the content within those boxes. We use the box model to space the content how we want it. the fix is creating an element at the top that controls the size of all boxes throughout the page.
